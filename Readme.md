# Introduction

This is my version of the classic 1972 arcade video game, Pong. The game is made with C++ and SDL2.
My primary goal with this project was to improve my skills with C++ and do something fun with the language.

I chose to remake Pong because the gameplay is very simple but at the same time it would be a challenge for me to implement all the mechanics and logic. Creating an entire graphics API was obivously out of the scope for this project, but using a game engine such as Unreal would make the creation of Pong trivial and I would spend a lot of time watching tutorials and familiarising myself with the engine. Making everything from the ground up using SDL2 was a good compromise in terms of difficulty.

# Controls

W/S controls the left player, up/down arrow keys controls the right player.

# Acknowledgements

This project only took a week to make, which I am very proud of. It was very fun to practise C++ and learn about the SDL2 library and I'm very satisfied with the final result!

The font used for the score and "Game Over" text is called DSEG7Classic-Regular, the license for it and more information can be found in the "Font" folder.

I want to thank [Lazy Foo' Productions](https://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/index.php) for their comprehensive and well-structured SDL2 tutorial. I had almost no experience with SDL2 before starting this project and their tutorial was great to familiarize myself with the library before creating this game by myself.
